# PX4-XPlane - PX4 X-Plane Integration Plugin

This project establishes a robust connection between X-Plane and PX4 SITL (Software In The Loop) to simulate drone flight in the X-Plane environment. Our goal is to deliver a realistic simulation experience where PX4 can control various drones within X-Plane, and with our continuous improvements, it's getting better all the time.

## Introduction

We bridge X-Plane and PX4 using the Simulator MAVLink API, which facilitates the exchange of sensor and actuator data, providing a rich and accurate simulation environment.

The following table illustrates the message flow:

| Message | Direction | Description |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| [MAV_MODE:MAV_MODE_FLAG_HIL_ENABLED](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#MAV_MODE_FLAG_HIL_ENABLED) | NA | Mode flag when using simulation. All motors/actuators are blocked, but internal software is fully operational. |
| [HIL_ACTUATOR_CONTROLS](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#HIL_ACTUATOR_CONTROLS) | PX4 to Sim | PX4 control outputs (to motors, actuators). |
| [HIL_SENSOR](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#HIL_SENSOR) | Sim to PX4 | Simulated IMU readings in SI units in NED body frame. |
| [HIL_GPS](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#HIL_GPS) | Sim to PX4 | The simulated GPS RAW sensor value. |
| [HIL_OPTICAL_FLOW](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#HIL_OPTICAL_FLOW) | Sim to PX4 | Simulated optical flow from a flow sensor (e.g., PX4FLOW or optical mouse sensor). |
| [HIL_STATE_QUATERNION](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#HIL_STATE_QUATERNION) | Sim to PX4 | Contains the actual "simulated" vehicle position, attitude, speed, etc. This can be logged and compared to PX4's estimates for analysis and debugging. |
| [HIL_RC_INPUTS_RAW](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#HIL_RC_INPUTS_RAW) | Sim to PX4 | The RAW values of the RC channels received. |

## Known Issues

- **Performance**: Ensure X-Plane runs at high FPS for optimal EKF performance.
- **Temporary Fix**: This plugin is a temporary fix until merged with the official PX4 repository. For now, we use a forked version of PX4 with custom airframes and modifications.
- **Bug Reports**: If you find any bug, please report it on the GitHub issues page.

## Usage Guide

For full step-by-step instructions, follow the [Version 2 Documentation](https://github.com/alireza787b/px4xplane/blob/master/docs/v2.md).

### Automated Setup Script

This automated script is optimized for using with **WSL** (Windows Subsystem for Linux), where X-Plane runs on Windows, and PX4 SITL runs on Linux (WSL). It also works natively on Ubuntu, Linux, and macOS distributions.

To quickly set up PX4 with X-Plane using WSL (Ubuntu 22.04), follow this simple step:

1. **Run the setup script directly from your terminal:**

   First, make sure you are in your WSL Ubuntu terminal (launch it from PowerShell), then enter the following command in your WSL terminal:

   ```bash
   cd ~ && curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alireza787b/px4xplane/master/setup/setup_px4_sitl.sh && bash setup_px4_sitl.sh
   ```

### Important Notes:

- **Time Required**: The installation process may take some time, depending on your system and configuration, especially the first time.
- **Prompts**: During installation, you will encounter several prompts asking you to customize the setup. You can either read and decide on each prompt or just let the defaults take effect (the script will automatically proceed with default settings if you don't respond).
- **Cross-Platform**: Now supports Linux and macOS natively with dedicated makefiles.

2. Once setup is complete, use the `px4xplane` command to run the simulation from anywhere in your terminal.

### Uninstall

To remove the global paths and the `px4xplane` command:

```bash
px4xplane --uninstall
```

### Manual Advanced Setup

For advanced users, manually clone and set up the environment using the forked PX4 repository:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alireza787b/PX4-Autopilot-Me.git --recursive
   cd PX4-Autopilot-Me
   ```

2. Set up the environment:
   ```bash
   bash ./Tools/setup/ubuntu.sh
   ```

3. Configure PX4 SITL:
   - In Windows Terminal, check your IP address (e.g., `172.21.144.1`):
     ```bash
     ipconfig
     ```
   - In the WSL Terminal, inside the PX4-Autopilot directory, set the PX4 simulation hostname with your IP:
     ```bash
     export PX4_SIM_HOSTNAME=172.21.144.1
     ```

4. Build the desired airframes:
   ```bash
   make px4_sitl xplane_ehang184
   ```

   Other airframes include:
   - `xplane_alia250`
   - `xplane_cessna172`
   - `xplane_tb2`

Refer to the [official PX4 WSL setup documentation](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/simulation/) for more details, but use the forked repository instead of the official PX4 repo until the changes are merged.

## Defining Custom Airframes

If you need to define new airframes for your simulation, follow the detailed guide here:

üëâ [How to Define Custom Airframes in PX4-XPlane](https://github.com/alireza787b/px4xplane/blob/master/docs/custom-airframe-config.md)

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up custom configurations, mapping PX4 channels to X-Plane datarefs, and integrating new airframes into your simulations. Whether you're using existing X-Plane models or creating new ones in Plane Maker, this guide has you covered.

- Adjusted COM_ARM_EKF_VEL (0.8) to prevent false velocity limit exceeded errors
- Optimized for simulation timing characteristics while maintaining accuracy

### User Interface Enhancements
Professional high-contrast UI system with:
- Centralized version management (VersionInfo.h)
- Color-coded connection status indicators
- Improved readability and real-time debugging information

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
With native Linux and macOS makefile support, PX4-XPlane 2.5.0 ensures seamless compilation and operation across all major platforms, making it accessible to a broader range of developers and researchers.
